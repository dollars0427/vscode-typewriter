# vscode-typewriter

A [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) extension that makes typewriter sounds as you type. 

You probably came here via [Silicon Valley Code Camp](www.siliconvalley-codecamp.com/Session/2016/mastering-vscode-building-your-first-extension) where I gave a 75 minute talk on VSCode. 
As this app was my demo, you'll find a few shortcuts and things one might do differently in a real-world example.
